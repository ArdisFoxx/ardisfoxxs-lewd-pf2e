# Session Zero

To incorporate this content into your campaign, discuss the specific content openly with your group during Session 0. Let players vote for one of the four baseline "Lewd Game Modes" below. The mode with the lowest numerical value that received at least one player vote should become the mode your group uses. This ensures everyone feels comfortable going into a new game.

rules (
# Corruption/Purity Arc
The below templates are a baseline for the start of your campaign. As your campaign develops, you may want to introduce lewd content from above your baseline, checking in with your players at the end of each session to confirm that they're enjoying it. Over the course of your campaign, your group might fall in love with the story and naturally move towards Lewd 1, or they may find that they enjoy the truly degenerate content and move all the way to Lewd 4!
)

## Lewd 1. Typical Anime
*You're strictly about the adventure. Sometimes you'll see sexy people.*
- Humanoids may be sexy and alluring. You won't see anything explicit. 
- Humanoids will not have sex with you.
- Monsters are 100% horrifying and not sexy.
- Monsters will not have sex with you.
- Sexual spells and items exist in the game, but only NPCs have access to them. 
- Sexual spells and items will not be used against you by NPCs. They may use items and spells that only alter their own body in a sexy way, such as *Bimbofied Armor* and *Cleavage Sheath*.

## Lewd 2. The Witcher III
*Magic spells might put you in a sexy predicament. You might have consensual sex.*
- Humanoids may be sexy and alluring. You may see something explicit. 
- Humanoids may have sex with you. 
- Monsters may be sexy and alluring, like big titty demi-humans or demons with huge cocks.
- Monsters will not have sex with you.
- Sexual spells and items exist, and you have access to some of the less explicit ones.
- Sexual spells and items might be used against you by NPCs. They may use items and spells that alter other peoples bodies in a sexy way, such as *Bagslut's Buttplug* or *Bondage Trap*.
- Sex is always consentual.

## Lewd 3. Skyrim with Sexy Mods
*Magic spells might fuck you in combat, but physical sex is still a consensual activity.*
- Humanoids may be sexy and alluring. You may see something explicit. 
- Humanoids may have sex with you. 
- Monsters may be sexy and alluring, like big titty demi-humans or demons with huge cocks.
- Monsters will not have sex with you.
- Sexual spells and items exist, and you have access to all of them. 
- Sexual spells and items might be used against you by NPCs. They may use items and spells that fuck another creature with magic or some unseen force, ones such as *Portal Plug of Free Use* or *Pink Tentacles*. 
- New rules are added to the game including the Arousal System, and new conditions such as Exposed, Horny, Mind Broken and Cumflated.
- Kinks are added to the game, including the starting kinks Dominant, Exhibitionist, and Submissive, and other kinks such as Bondage Princess, Cum Slut and Aphrodisiac Junkie.
- Sex is always consentual, unless its a spell effect.

=

## Lewd 4. Skyrim with Defeat Mods
*Monsters might defeat you and fill you with thick monster cum right in the middle of combat.*
- Humanoids may be sexy and alluring. You may see something explicit. 
- Humanoids may have sex with you. 
- Monsters may be sexy and alluring, like big titty demi-humans or demons with huge cocks.
- Monsters may have sex with you.
- Sexual spells and items exist, and you have access to all of them. 
- Sexual spells and items might be used against you by NPCs. They may use items and spells that enable the creature to be fucked by another physical creature, such as Animal Tail Plug or Flesh to Fleshlight. 
- Sex may involve consensual non-consent. X Cards and safewords are enabled. This means NPCs or creatures may have non-consensual sex with your character during combat encounters, but you as a player are cool with it as part of the game dynamic and are consenting to it in advance, with the option to change your mind on that at any point and halt the game or skip the scene at any time.
- New kinks that interact with monsters are added to the game including Cum Slut and Creature Fetish. Monsters with the Sexual trait and Sexual attacks and abilities are added to the game. TPKs may be replaced with "Bad Ends" where, in the case where an encounter ends with the whole party being defeated, instead of death, the party is taken to the monster's lairs to become sex slaves. This usually involves a cut scene to narrate the passage of time, the PCs gaining a Creature Fetish, and then being released or having an opportunity to escape, re-equip and get revenge.
- Player Feats with the Sexual trait are added to the game, such as the advanced kinks Dommy Mommy/Daddy, Power Bottom and Size Queen.

# Using the Rules
The following sections detail specific content for each Lewd Game Mode.
## Lewd 1. Typical Anime
In a game using this mode, the changes to your typical Pathfinder 2e experience are minimal. 

### Spells and Items
The GM adds certain Items and spells with the Sexual trait to merchants, treasure rewards and NPC spell repertoirs that only affect the item wearer or caster. They shouldn't target or affect others, but instead allow PCs and NPCs to lewdify themselves as a form of sexy self expression or utility buff.

Sexual spells are intentionally part of every magic tradition (arcane, divine, primal, occult). This is simply for the fact that Sexual spells are few in number and we want to make it easy for player characters and NPCs to have access to cast them, or create items that require being able to cast them.

## Lewd 2. The Witcher III
In a game using this mode, we immediately see a steep increase in sexy content compared to Lewd 1, with consentual sex scenes between humanoids becoming possible. 

### Spells and Items
The GM should add Items and Spells to merchants, treasure rewards and NPC spell repertoirs that alter other people's bodies, not just the self. Sexual Items and Spells added to the game include ones that cause "lewdification", arousal change and sexy predicaments. Items and Spells that cause actual sex acts and penetration should not be included in this mode.

The GM might trap a treasure chest in a dungeon with the Bondage Trap spell, or an NPC caster might cast the Clothes to Oil, Horny Hex or Erogenous Overload spells on a PC. A captured PC might be equipped with bondage items or bimbofied clothing. 

### Kinks
The GM should add Kinks to the game, including the Starting Kinks of Dominant, Exhibitionist and Submissive, and also Aphrodisiac Junkie and Bondage Princess. Kinks that relate to sex or cumflation should not be added.

Kinks are a type of condition that give a character a debuff, making it easier for their Arousal to increase, while also giving them a buff or a new ability. Most Kinks are gained by abilities or spells that apply a Kink. Starting Kinks can be applied to characters for free at level 1.

A Mind Broken character is more likely to gain new Kinks when engaging in Sexual activities that relate to the Kink. For example, even though the Dire Wolf Alpha doesn't apply bondage to a character, if a character is wearing bondage when it becomes Mind Broken by a Dire Wolf Alpha, the GM may ask the player to roll a DC11 flat check, with a failure resulting in the character gaining the Bondage Princess Kink. Kinks can be removed from characters as a downtime Activity through Retraining (Kink).

#### Starting Kinks
item (
# Dominant
## Kink
-
;Sexual
**Starting Kink** You can choose this kink at character creation.

You're a natural dominant. You gain a rush of pleasure whenever a submissive creature obeys you, and your dominant nature lets you sway creatures into submitting before you.
When you successfully use Coerce, Demoralize or Request on another creature, you become Horny.

**Panty Dropper** :f: (sexual)
You swing your weight around in conversations easily when sex is on the table.

**Effect** You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the check, and both you and the target of your check become Horny.
)

item (
# Submissive
## Kink
-
;Sexual
**Starting Kink** You can choose this kink at character creation.
-
You're a trained submissive. You gain a rush of pleasure whenever a dominant creature takes control of you, and your submissive nature lets you get away with things that more confrontational folk might not.
When a creature successfully uses Coerce, Demoralize or Request on you, you become Horny.

**Slutty Diplomacy** :F: (sexual)
You're skilled at flattering words and using your body to get your way, while convincing people that they're still in charge.
**Trigger** You make a Diplomacy check
-
**Effect** You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the check, and both you and the target of your check become Horny.
)

item (
# Switch
## Kink
-
;Sexual
**Starting Kink** You can choose this kink at character creation.
-
You can freely switch between dominant and submissive roles. You gain a rush of pleasure whenever expressing yourself in either role with another creature. If a feature has the Dominant or Submissive kinks as a requirement, you are treated as if you had both of those kinks.
When a creature successfully uses Coerce, Demoralize or Request on you, or when you successfully use these actions on another, you become Horny.

**I'm Everybody's Type** :F: (sexual)
You slip into dominant and submissive roles naturally while speaking to others. You frequently find they're too busy staring at your ass to focus on what you're saying, and their lewd gaze turns you on.
**Trigger** You make a Deception check
-
**Effect** You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the check, and both you and the target of your check become Horny.
)

#### General Kinks
item (
# Aphrodisiac Junkie
## Kink
-
;Sexual
Your brain has been totally pickled by lust. When you're affected by Aphrodisiacs, you'll bend over like a brain-dead fuck toy and beg to be taken. You become Mind Broken.

**There Is No Goon** :F: (sexual)
You've found a state of horny meditative zen from constant exposure to Aphrodisiacs. While affected by Aphrodisiacs you gain a +4 status bonus to saves against spells and effects with the Mental or Emotional trait.
)

=

item (
# Bondage Princess
## Kink
-
;Sexual
You love being tied up, strapped in harnesses, bound with manacles, blindfolded, gagged and put on a leash like a good little pet. Just thinking about being bound and helpless makes you wet and ready to submit.
While affected by bondage, you are Horny.

**Adventuring While Helpless** :F: (sexual)
You're so experienced with bondage that it doesn't restrict you as much as it used to. Your hearing becomes sharper while you are Blinded, granting you Echolocation 60 feet (Echolocation allows you to use hearing as a precise sense at the listed range). You ignore the first 10 feet of any movement penalties from leg restraints, and you can use a manipulate action while in arm restraints if you succeed a DC 5 Flat Check. If you fail the check, you can use an action to succeed instead.
*Bondage includes items and spells with the Bondage trait, such as manacles, arm binders, harnesses, gags, collars, hobble dresses, leashes and blindfolds.*

item (
# Exhibitionist
## Kink
-
;Sexual
**Starting Kink** You can choose this kink at character creation.
-
Being sexually harassed while in embarrassing states of undress titillates you. You flaunt your fat ass, deliberately enticing your enemies to molest you, inviting anyone who might pass your way for a quick, easy lay.
While you are Exposed, you are Horny.

**Cat Call Conditioning** :F: (sexual)

Being objectified daily has made you become unfazed by casual intimidation. When a creature causes you to become Frightened, you reduce the level of Frightened by 1 and become Horny instead.
)

item (
# Retraining (Kink)
## Activity
-
;Downtime, Sexual
**Category** interaction
-
Kink retraining offers a structured way to alter a character’s deeply ingrained erotic predispositions, should they wish to move away from identities like Aphrodisiac Junkie, Bondage Princess, Creature Fetish, Cum Slut, or Exhibitionist. This process involves devoting a period of focused downtime to intensive study and personal reflection, usually under the guidance of a trusted mentor or therapist. During these sessions, you engage in targeted exercises—ranging from reflective counseling and controlled exposure to meditative practices aimed at understanding and reframing your desires—to gradually replace your former fixation with a more balanced approach to intimacy.

Much like standard retraining, you must commit to this activity without mixing it with other downtime pursuits. You can spend a week of downtime retraining to redefine your erotic expression and remove one kink.

## Lewd 3. Skyrim with Sex Mods
In a game using this mode, sex acts via magic become possible. 

### Spells and Items
The GM should add Items and Spells to merchants, treasure rewards and NPC spell repertoirs that include Sexual spells that fuck creatures, or cause them to cum instantly. These Items and Spells can be used in combat as a form of incapacitation, or used on willing PCs and NPCs for fun.

The GM might have NPC spellcasters use Power Word Nut or Pink Tentacles on the PCs, and they might add cursed items to the game such as Portal Plug of Free Use that trick the PCs into being fucked via magic. In this way, the mode has a slight noncon theme to it, but the noncon elements are impersonal, faceless magic effects.

### Kinks
The GM can add Kinks to the game that relate to sex and Cumflation, such as Cum Slut.
#### Kinks
item (
# Cum Slut
## Kink
-
;Sexual
You're used to carrying thick loads of spunk inside of you, and you love it. This is your life now. You're on your knees daily, attached to a dick more often than not, a bottom-of-the-barrel bitch who loves being used as a cum dump by any passer-by, and everyone knows it as soon as they look at you.

**Career Cum Dump** :F: (sexual)

You're no longer bothered by cumflation effects, and while cumflated you are Horny.
)
### Arousal System
The Arousal System is introduced. The GM should add the Arousal Points and Cum Volume effects to all creatures, including PCs, NPCs and monsters. 

#### Arousal Points
All creatures have Arousal Points (AP). Your Arousal Point value represents your sex drive and how easily you cum. Your Arousal Points are usually 1 until affected by something that increases it. 

When you take damage with the Sexual trait, or when you deal damage with Breed or a Sexual attack, your Arousal Points increase by the value of the damage.

When your Arousal Points are higher than half of your maximum Hit Points, you become Horny. When your Arousal Points equal or exceed your maximum Hit Points, you Cum.

Some spells, items, and other effects, as well as simply resting, can decrease Arousal in creatures. When you make your daily preparations, your Arousal is reduced to 1.

#### Cum Volume
The total volume of your own cum stored in your bodily reservoir. Each unit of cum is 125ml in a fantasy setting (where filling a creature causes Cumflation), or 2ml of fluid in a realistic setting. Creatures without penises are not able to cause Cumflation in other creatures through sex, and each unit of cum might be as low as 1ml.

Your maximum Cum Volume is set by your size, and any feats or items that grant Coomer to increase it.

Certain feats, items and spells can restore your Cum Volume instantly. You naturally restore your Cum Volume by half its maximum value each hour.

</tr></tbody>
</table>

*The Creature Size table shows how much cum a creature has based on their size.*

##### Foundry Macro - Arousal Change
The Arousal Change macro manages arousal and cum volume for selected tokens. It opens a pop-up that lets you adjust arousal levels, track cum volume, and apply effects like Horny, Coomer, or Amorous Activity. You can apply changes to multiple creatures at once, and use the “Replenish Cum for All” button to refill everyone’s cum volume based on their size. If a token doesn’t already have the Arousal Points or Cum Volume effects, the macro applies them with the correct starting values based on size and any Coomer counters. It sends individual chat messages per token and automates transitions: adding Horny at the right arousal, generating a cum prompt, and removing Amorous Activity and applying Afterglow when sex ends. The macro is included in the module and can be used by the GM to manage these effects efficiently.

### Cumflation
As an optional addition to the Lewd 4 mode, the GM can apply Cumflation effects (when a creature has so much cum inside them it makes them Clumsy) to creatures when a spell effect causes it.

#### Cumflation
When a creature with a penis Cums inside another creature, it causes Cumflation. The creature's belly swells as they are filled with copious amounts of creamy lust.

Each of the three holes (ass, pussy, mouth) of a selected token can be cumflated up to a maximum value of 8, and the total of those 3 values are then added together and divided by 3 (rounded down) to get a final Cumflated condition effect. The effect of Cumflated on a character is equivalent to Clumsy, as the sloshing liquid and the pressure cumflation places on internal organs makes movement difficult.

A creature filled in holes at once rolls a DC 11 flat check, and gains the Cum Slut kink on a success. This allows them to ignore the harsh penalties of Clumsy while making it easier to become Horny, making the Cum Slut easily preyed on by Sexual monsters.

##### Foundry Macro - Cumflation
The "Cumflation" macro manages cumflation levels for a creature’s Anal, Oral, and Vaginal holes, automatically applying or adjusting effects and posting a random lewd message to chat for each hole that is filled. When all three holes are filled, a special "dominating" message is triggered, along with a 50% chance to apply the Cum Slut effect unless it’s already active, which changes the type of effects applied. Each hole also includes a "Purge" button that rolls a Fortitude save for the selected token to attempt relief, with a critical failure resulting in a 1 hour cooldown on repeat attempts.

## Lewd 4. Skyrim with Defeat Mods
In a game using this mode, sexual defeat becomes a part of the game. Combat encounters now include NPCs and monsters with the Sexual trait. These creatures have Sexual attacks that can incapacitate creatures and cause them to cum or lose their mind to feelings of lust.

### Kinks

The GM should add player feats such as the Advanced Kinks to the game. This allows PCs to defeat monsters with Sexual attacks as well.
#### Advanced Kinks

![MindBroken](https://github.com/ArdisFoxx/ardisfoxxs-lewd-pf2e/blob/main/assets/Lewd%20Tokens/MindBroken_By_ArdisFoxx_Wallpaper.jpg?raw=true)

### Monsters and Defeat
In Pathfinder the reasons for a monster to want to fight or kill the player characters are nearly as numerous and varied as the monsters themselves, and when it comes to their sexual desires, the same is true. Some monsters may be horny all the time and desire to fuck any adventurers they come across, only to leave their prey unconscious and unharmed when the monster has satisfied its urges. Other monsters may see sex with prey as another form of domination, relishing in their total conquest. Feral monsters may see sex and a mere precursor to the slaughter and consumption of the prey they consider food, while intelligent monsters may see adventurers as potential sex slaves to be taken back to their lairs. Civilized monsters may use bondage items on captured prey to enforce their domination on defeated foes, making their escape a difficult challenge.

Noncon is a nuanced fantasy with many different layers. If your players choose this mode as part of Session 0, discuss monster fantasies and noncon with your group. Some players might like sex and violence to be separate things, where the safety of their character in a sexual defeat scenario is guaranteed. They might be excited about a monster defeating them and having their way, only to be shocked and saddened when their character is killed or eaten by the monster afterwards. Because of this, the default assumption by the GM should be that monsters will not kill player characters after breeding them.

Many monsters will simply leave once they are satisfied, but even in a Bad End (TPK) scenario, Sexual monsters are more likely to want to keep the characters as breeding pets. This can lead to a session where the player characters attempt an bold escape from the monsters lair, retrieve their lost equipment and then return to get revenge on the monsters who defeated them.

=

#### Sex in Combat
Monsters with Sexual attacks generally have a similar action rotation when they get within melee of a character that they want to defeat:

Strike > Strip (applies Exposed) > Mount (applies Prone, Restrained) > Breed (Sexual Nonlethal damage).

Using this action rotation, players have a chance to respond and beat an enemy back before it can start to Breed a character. Breed deals automatic Sexual damage to the target creature so it can't crit or miss, and the damage increases the Arousal Points of both the monster and the target creature.

When a creature's Arousal Points reach half their maximum Hit Points they become Horny, which makes it even harder to Escape the Restrained condition applied by Mount due to the Sexual trait. If that happens, it might be up to the character's allies to save them, before the whole party is overrun!

Once a creature reaches 0 Hit Points from Sexual damage, they become Mind Broken. In this state of defeat, the character becomes a useless cocksheath and is used as a monster's personal cumdump, at least until the monster empties their balls, gets bored and wanders off.

#### The Balance of Sexual Attack Design
For monsters in a combat encounter, a successfull Mind Break on a player character - or even landing multiple Breed attacks in a row - can be quite difficult. But compared to more traditional forms of defeat in a Pathfinder game (ie: character death) sexual defeat in a lewd campaign can be a lot of fun! So to make sexual defeat easier to reach, Sexual attacks are unbalanced by design through two powerful debuffs - Exposed, and Horny. 
Many monsters are embodyments of lust or are feral creatures who don't wear "exposable" armor, and are thus immune to these effects. This balance ensures that in a combat encounter with a Sexual monster, the monster actually has a chance to do something fun before the player characters destroy it.

In a battle against Sexual monsters, player characters might try to avoid defeat as much as possible, resisting and fighting back while avoiding the Exposed and Horny debuffs and any corrupting kinks as much as they can. However other characters might be "recreational losers", relishing sexual defeat at the hands of monsters and making it easy for the monsters to instantly defeat them. Some characters may even use their bodies as a sexual weapon in its own right, dominating monsters with sex much in the same way that monsters do, or submissively "tanking" sexual monsters to keep them away from their allies.

#### Player Characters and Defeat
Player characters that gain Sexual attacks through the Advanced Kink feats will find they suddenly have access to some very powerful abilities. Sexual monsters are immune to the Exposed and Horny debuffs that make Sexual attacks so unbalanced, but what of non-Sexual NPCs or other player characters who don't share that immunity? With the ability to dominate any creature they wish at will, some players can turn a lewd game into a sour experience for everyone. At best, characters without Sexual attacks may feel redundant beneath the shadow of the characters who have them, and at worst, a "murder hobo" type player with Sexual attacks may turn a lewd game on its head by defeating every single NPC that looks at them the wrong way, every merchant that doesn't give them a fair deal, or even other player characters at the table.

As the GM, if you allow player characters to take the Advanced Kink feats, discuss this with your group and let your players know that just because they have these abilities, it doesn't mean they should be defeating and fucking everything in sight. Treat the new abilities like an explosive new spell - to be used at the right time.

Failing that, consider adding the below divine retributions to the "Dommy Mommy/Daddy" and "Power Bottom" Advanced Kinks respectively, as a way to encourage fair play and curb any "murder-rapist hobo" tendencies by putting some rails around them.

# BDSM Code - Dominant
You follow the dominant code of Cayden. If a creature willingly submits to you, or a creature attempts to kill you in combat unprovoked, you see their sexual defeat as a right and true conquest. You find glory in making such creatures cum and fall unconscious from pleasure, leaving them helpless and wanting more.

**Anathema** Sexually attacking unwilling creatures without deadly provocation or slaughtering creatures made unconscious through Sexual attacks is anathema to Cayden's will. You feel Sickened 2 by your actions, you are unable to gain Arousal, become Horny or Cum, and you lose the benefits of this kink until you undergo an Atonement ritual with a Caydenite priest guiding your reaffirmation of the code.

# BDSM Code - Submissive
You follow the submissive code of Arshea.

# Behind the Cum
Building the Cum Volume elements of [ArdisFoxx's Lewd PF2e](https://www.patreon.com/ardisfoxxart/shop/ardisfoxxs-lewd-pf2e-1272244?source=storefront) took quite a bit of thought and testing, as it needed to balance Cumflation against the Cum Volume and account for Arousal and Cum frequency. Here's the breakdown:
- We'll start with the Cumflation system, because that was already built in 1.0.0.
- Cumflation (8) is considered the "maximum Cumflation", where the stomach, ass or pussy is entirely full. 
- The human body can store around a liter of fluid in it's stomach, or 1000 ml. This sets a baseline for how many mls fills one of the 3 holes up completely (It can stretch to have up to 4000 ml, but that sounds more like a Size Queen kink than a baseline). Dividing 1000 by 8 is 125, so each 1 unit of Cumflation equates to 125 ml of cum. Fill someone with 8 units, and that's 1000 ml. 
- Next, we need to figure out how much cum creatures of various sizes can produce in their body (we'll call it Maximum Cum Volume), and also how many mls are in the average cum shot for each creature size. 
- We need to figure out two sets of values - fantasy (with Cumflation), and realistic. We don't know the fantasy values off hand, but we can research what the realistic values are for a couple of real world creatures and use them as a baseline.
- A quick search tells us the average human male shoots between 1.25 - 5 ml of cum per shot. We know a horse in Pathfinder is a large creature, and according to Google horses shoot between 15 to 150ml of cum per shot.
- We'll assume diminishing returns on each shot within a short period - each time they cum, their total cum is reduced by half its current total. So they can get maybe two good shots out. 
- If we set the Maximum Cum Volume of a medium creature (a human) to 4, and of a large creature (a horse) to 80, and we assume that they lose half their current Cum Volume each time they cum, this leaves us with a good first shot of 2 "units" of cum for a human, and 40 for a horse. We'll set each unit of cum to equate to 2 ml of fluid as a generous "realistic" value, making a human's first cumshot shoot 4 ml, and a horse shoot 80 ml.
- We'll assume the values for creatures of other sizes; Tiny, Small, Huge and Gargantuan. Dogs and cats dont shoot much less than a human (in fact some dogs shoot more), so we'll set the Maximum Cum Volume to 2 for a Small creature and 1 for a Tiny creature. We'll apply a Coomer kink to dogs and wolves to increase their Cum Volume.
- We know that horses shoot quite a lot more cum per shot than a human, so it seems that the values really take off with creatures larger than humans. Large having around 20x the shot of a human is a good baseline, so we'll continue it, setting Huge creatures (a giant) to (80 x 20) 1600 units of Maximum Cum Volume, and gargantuan creatures (an ancient dragon) to (1600 x 20) 32000 units.

We now have the full picture. So we can know, for example, that in a fantasy setting, given the values for Maximum Cum Volume on a gargantuan creature, and the value of 125 ml of cum per unit of Cumflation, that an ancient dragon shoots (1600 units of cum x 125 ml) 2000000 ml of cum with its first cumshot, or 2000 liters. Which is approximately the same amount of liquid that will fill a large bath, like a jacuzzi.

# Lovense Integration:
The Lovense integration is composed of 3 parts; the Foundry module outputting to the console, a Web Browser configured to save that console to a log file in real time, and an app listening to the log file for triggers to send to your Lovense toy. 

## Player Setup of Lovense Integration:
1. Players should download the [AFLP Lovense Integration](https://github.com/ArdisFoxx/ardisfoxxs-lewd-pf2e/blob/main/AFLP_Lovense_Integration.zip).
2. Extract it anywhere on your computer.
3. Run one of the Chrome or Edge shortcuts within the folder to launch a web browser in logging mode. Login to your Foundry world in that browser. 
4. Run GameInterfaceForToys.exe. Note that Windows Smart Screen can produce a false positive detecting it as suspicious software, because the software hasn't seen any use so it has no repuation. This is a known issue with software packaged in Git. This software is perfectly safe and open source, and you can view the full code here https://github.com/MinLL/GameInterfaceForToys.
5. Tap Settings.
6. Click "Select another log file" and navigate to: 
`%localappdata%\Google\Chrome\User Data` for Chrome, or
`%localappdata%\Microsoft\Edge\User Data` for Edge. 
Double click the chrome_debug.log file. (If you don't see the file, apply some conditions to your character in your Foundry session so the browser has something to log)
7. Change the "In-game character name" to the name of your player character in Foundry.
8. Change the Lovense Host IP address and port in GameInterfaceForToys settings to match the IP and port shown in your Lovense app under Discover > Game Mode. (EG: 192.168.1.187:20010)
9. Click Save to exit the settings.
10. Make sure your Lovense App is on and your toy is connected. Then Click Reload Toys.
11. Click Configure Events.
12. Scroll to the bottom and click Select All.
13. Scroll down and click Save.
14. You're ready to go! To test it, try applying the Exposed or Horny conditions to your character. You can edit the strength or duration of each type of vibration by editing the values in AFLP_Lovense_Integration\data\events\games\ardisfoxxslewdpf2e\aflp.yaml.

note (
# How Does it Work?
The console messages are logged in a format of [Date - Time] ActorName, Effect.

For example: 

`[03/20/2025 - 11:30:36PM] Neela, Horny`. 

`[03/20/2025 - 11:38:19PM] Neela, damage`.

The module manifest comes with a shortcut for Edge and Chrome browser. If you have either of these browsers installed, when you open one of these shortcuts it will launch the browser in logging/debug mode. In this mode, console events are saved to a log file. This file is saved in:
"C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\chrome\_debug.log" for Edge browser, or
"C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\chrome_debug.log" for Chrome browser.

The module manifest comes with a custom install of [Game Interface For Toys](https://github.com/MinLL/GameInterfaceForToys), pre-configured to detect AFLP events.
